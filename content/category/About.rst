Klimenko Maxim Sergievich
=========================

| IT administrator and GNU/Linux user, ~black~ ( final version of supressive ) person for scientology from my 7, but I don't have much knowledge about hardware and networking on level ~about tele control~ because I didn't get lessons or knowlege from Scientology hackers, they come to me, in almost all cases, for blackmail, theft of information and to install a backdoor on my equipment. A self-proclaimed member of the Civil Defense of the USRR ( ! communist,scientologist/andropov/beria fun ), I want and will always know and remember my history and the history of my country.
  If you ask me, I don't allow Scientology people and cyber-criminals to use me and my work, but who asks... and by the way, I use Arch Linux.
| I can publish one variant then, after days, remember something and update all the site - because my memory is like a controlled disk.
