| IT administrator and GNU/Linux Demonic Space Pirate ( ! online ) and "black" man in Scientology - because they decide to control me ( ! online ). And sometimes a cloud infrastructure engineer and always without faith.
| If you ask me, I don't allow Scientology people and cyber-criminals to use me and my work, but who asks... and by the way, I use Arch Linux.
| I can publish one variant then, after days, remember something an update all site :)

| Im do not support Ukraine or Russia in Russian/Ukraine war but im on Ukrainian side. I think both countryes is political regimes with a lack of respect for human rights. To support the policy of dictatorship and sale of people is obviously unacceptable. For me. But I have buissines and pay taxes to Ukraine and follow the laws. I am captive, they everyday radiate me by EMF and by this damage my heatlh and everyday attack my devices and steal info or brainwash me, all this they do on their own initiative, but I do not recognize any right of Ukrainian and foreign criminals, be it the army, the police, the people or the governing bodies. I am not a Scientologist and certainly will not be one myself and never was. I`m don`t want live in anarcho-capitalism ( criminals and scientology communas ) and I hate anarcho-capitalism.
| We live in USSR style countries with cults after multiple psyops against us and our goverments create psyops against us too .... and today groups of military developed hackers-zombi, are my enemy, they live in Ukraine local cults ( anarcho capitalism ), can try too brainwash you and force to change your sexusal orientation, try to harm or force to commit suicide. And I, after 2 years of electromagnetic burning, feel like in a prison with a dead brain, are fighting all "their" world - they need to change the firmware of the brain ... But all this time I just live in my house with my grandfather and try to work in IT like in my past. All the participants of the described and unmentioned actions are my sworn enemies - most of them are citizens of Ukraine - they torture me for days to make my brain obey every electromagnetic or verbal command.

Foreword from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
===============================================================

**Armies, students, and some societies are programmed. An
assault on large problems employs a succession of programs, most of
which spring into existence en route. these programs are rife with issues
that appear to be particular to the problem at hand. To appreciate
programming as an intellectual activity in its own right you must turn to
computer programming; you must read and write computer programs - many of them. ........ 
Our traffic with the subject matter of this book involves us with
three foci of phenomena: the human mind, collections of computer programs,
and the computer. Every computer program is a model, hatched
in the mind, of a real or mental process. These processes, arising from
human experience and thought, are huge in number, intricate in detail,
and at any time only partially understood. They are modeled to our
permanent satisfaction rarely by our computer programs. Thus even
though our programs are carefully handcrafted discrete collections of
symbols, mosaics of interlocking functions, they continually evolve: we
change them as our perception of the model deepens, enlarges, generalizes
until the model ultimately attains a metastable place within
still another model with which we struggle. The source of the exhilaration
associated with computer programming is the continual unfolding
within the mind and on the computer of mechanisms expressed as
programs and the explosion of perception they generate. If art interprets
our dreams, the computer executes them in the guise of programs!**
