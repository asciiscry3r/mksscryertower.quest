===================================

IT administrator and GNU/Linux fan. And sometimes a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer | If you ask me - I'm don`t allow use me and me work to people from *Scientology* and cyber-criminals, but who ask ... and BTW I`m use Arch Linux. In our days we can find criminals and slave traders in police departments, army or other government services ( like SSU ) and this people can be in *scientology*... Like piracy and "hackers" ( pseudo hackers or just fucking criminals ) from mirgorod and other cult controlled city. And they try to control me like electromagnetic disraptor chases away crowd of birds, they do this every day. Who super-genius give work in police or army to the people form cults? .....

I want to apologize to modern, non-criminal and normal members of Scientology or other religious society, this is not about you.

I may write here what "people" already knew, but then I just learned that the "native" army ( in past they be a part of army, but now I too far from this structures ) and its assistants forbade me to know because they wanted to use me as a pair with their assistants.

Fucking stupid assholes decide take me to the slavery and share all my life from every day to Ukrainian unofficial Scientology members, they work on my brainwashing like n the past but with nuances from Aum Shinrikyo. In Ukraine they can steal your passport e-government and ..... but it not main reason, in this place they like human traders - they do not recognize the rights of their chosen people and invent reasons for this. And I, after 2 years of electromagnetic burning, feel myself like in prison with dead brain. But all this time I just live in my home with my grandpa and work in IT.

I can publish one variant then, after days,
 remember something an update all site :)
