#######################

The brain does not operate in just one single frequency; the full spectrum of brainwave frequencies are always running, all the time. The dominant frequency determines our mental state – and entrainment temporarily shifts our mental state by boosting one frequency to be louder than the others.

The brain can be entrained within a certain frequency range, known as the Frequency Following Response (FFR) and was discovered by neuroscientists in the 1930s.

Worden, F. & Marsh, J. Frequency-following (microphonic-like) neural responses evoked by sound. Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 25, 42–52 (1968).

Types Of Brainwave Entertainment:

*    Music Modulation
*    Monaural Beats
*    Binaural Beats
*    Isochronic Beats
*    Sound and Light
*    EEG Active
*    Electromagnetic (EM)

Brainwave entertainment in mafia/cults or in inhuman countries ( MkUltra / Scientology / Ukraine people( they call self a hackers ) brainwashed by OSA/Guardians ) - IMHO JFF

* Delta Waves – (0.1 – 3.9 Hz) — When in a deep, dreamless sleep. Newborns sleep in this stage, adults less so.

* Theta Waves – (4 – 7.9 Hz) — Dreaming sleep (REM), this is the goal for meditation or self-hypnosis.

* Alpha Waves – (8 – 13.9 Hz) — Relaxed, daydreaming and watching TV.

* Beta Waves – (14 – 30 Hz) — The awake state. Engaged in activities and conversation.

* Gamma Waves – (31 Hz+) — Hyper alert, good for insights and higher learning.

phone magnetometer can`t record brain waves - he need ability to measure super low power fields ( nano Tesla or in pico Telsa ):
