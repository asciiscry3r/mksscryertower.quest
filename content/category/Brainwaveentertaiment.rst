* Delta Waves – (0.1 – 3.9 Hz) — When in a deep, dreamless sleep. Newborns sleep in this stage, adults less so.

* Theta Waves – (4 – 7.9 Hz) — Dreaming sleep (REM), this is the goal for meditation or self-hypnosis.

* Alpha Waves – (8 – 13.9 Hz) — Relaxed, daydreaming and watching TV.

* Beta Waves – (14 – 30 Hz) — The awake state. Engaged in activities and conversation.

* Gamma Waves – (31 Hz+) — Hyper alert, good for insights and higher learning.
