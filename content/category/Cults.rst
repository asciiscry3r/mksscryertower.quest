Another cult leader, Fumihiro Joyu, now 35 years old, was a bright young engineer with the Japanese space program, specializing in artificial intelligence. He left that organization to go to work for Aum, where he very quickly rose through the ranks, ultimately to head the cult's operations in Russia. Joyu oversaw this important cult expansion, among other things "investing" as much as $12 million in the form of payoffs to well-placed officials. The cult's investment paid off with expedited access to office buildings, dormitories, and other facilities throughout Russia. At the time of the Tokyo subway attack, the cult's principle venture in Russia was the Moscow-Japan University, with headquarters in offices across the street from the Bolshoi Ballet. Their senior Russian partner in the university was a man by the name of Oleg Lobov, at that time also chairman of Russia's National Security Council and a close confidant of Boris Yeltsin. This organisation has been disbanded by the security services from different countries.

In the situation of human trafficking, the following basic rights are violated:

* prohibition or restriction of freedom of movement - violates the right of a person to freedom and safety of a person and freedom of movement;

* cruel and degrading treatment - many forms of human trafficking, as a rule, include physical, sexual and mental violence, which constitutes a fact of cruel and degrading treatment;

* prohibition or limitation of the right to freedom of speech, access to information and association - many victims of human trafficking are denied these rights within the framework of coercive control mechanisms through which traffickers exploit them;

* denial or restriction of the right to private or family life – in many cases, victims are forcibly or fraudulently taken from their families and denied the desire to have a private life and family;

* Denial or limitation of the right to a decent standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing – in many cases, especially in various forms of labor exploitation, victims are constantly denied an adequate standard of food or housing and are often kept in dire and dangerous living conditions;

* denial or limitation of the right to health care standards - the vast majority of victims are exploited in a way that is inherently life-threatening, such as providing sexual services without proper protection or working in dangerous mines, factories, etc., and, apart from moreover, they are denied access to medical facilities, resulting in a large number of serious injuries and illnesses that they suffer as a result of direct exploitation as victims of human trafficking;

* restrictions on the right to education - many children and adolescents affected by human trafficking are separated from their families and do not have access to any form of education.

Cybercrimes for control your requests to police and other law enforcement agencies. Total surveillance allows them to give their lawyers data before it reaches the state and sometimes change it at their own will. People like `Gribanova`_ ( Narconon ) and `Konev`_ ( OSA, IMHO ) start work with army and childrens in schools and create in country something like lobby for their sphere of the interest. Myrgorod, Kyiv and Kharkiv cult members from `Sea Org`_ - mafia at most, `Narconon`_ - Social workers, `Criminon`_ - police and prosecutor's and `OSA`_ - army, goverment and SBU. This scheme is my opinion. And this all orgs sound like Battlefield Earth with brainwashing.

About Scientology "Narconon" and other "educational" programs

As a result of research, it was found that the lectures themselves and the way they are conducted violate the fundamental European bioethical principles of informed consent and presumption of guilt (until the usefulness and safety of medical or psychological technology is proven, it is considered harmful and dangerous). In addition, according to scientists, Narconon lectures are psycho-manipulative in nature and contain pseudo-scientific concepts. Experts concluded that the program is the first step in the process of attracting young people to the Scientology sect. "In essence, this is a biomedical experiment not sanctioned by society"
