In short - is a slowly murder if someone from police, mafia, security service or army start radiate you every day. I may write here what "people" already knew, but then I just learned that the "native" army ( in past they be a part of army, but now I too far from this structures ) and its assistants forbade me to know because they wanted to use me with their assistants ( like unofficial scientology or bandits ). We have many people, like someone Konev, Ribalko, Riabchevskiy, some part of SSU, police and Interpol and others, who want keep this status quo. They call this all a GAME.

Why:

Part of GSM mobile broadband part of spectrum and lower can be used for creating process of the `neurodegeneration`_ for "non needed" people.

And suppress neuronal activity or damage organism functions.
