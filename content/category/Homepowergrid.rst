Factors affecting the civilian population during a war between countries or mafia attacks:

1. microwave attacks to take away will or modulated by ultra-low frequencies for control
2. charging equipment to shock a person with a current or field pulse
3. power wires without large inductance and that are not grounded from different frequencies bring harmful radiation into the house
4. grounding can be an ultra-low frequency radio station
5. ultra-low frequencies and harmful food products (formaldehyde) are in sum a recipe for successful control of citizens
6. resonant frequencies from the fact that the equipment is turned on in the house

I try to create low-pass and high-pass filters for powering my appartment trought them:
