<p>Today's civilization uses augmentation by radio in many types of human activities, transhumanism is everywhere, from the police and the armed forces to information technology and other things, bypassing only institutions that do not require complex calculations, but there is also a &quot;right&quot;. And, this say science, but only with previous sentence: The human brain perceives radio induction as phenomena of fantasy and other things, through 'processing' by forcing perversions and inflicting insults by specially trained people, to my perception after years of living on fish oil, huge groups of amino acids, vitamins, theamine, guarana, niacin, ginseng and other plant extracts, etc. artificial can be, and I had, phenomena of fantasy, inner voice, emotions, feelings of excitement, dreams and what I have now forgotten.</p>
<p>And this form of the most modern, since 1982 in my country, which has failed, has moved to stagnation and the collection of technical means of implementation, began with the completely incomprehensible and inadequate hanging of the label &quot;products of a planned economy&quot; on all &quot;not such&quot;. Throwing away people's documents that were collected from their birth and giving them new ones, written by a crying &quot;soviet&quot; officer, because &quot;I see my homeland rising from its knees&quot;. And what they say is &quot;by the will of our people you are slaves, we have radio stations on all frequencies&quot;. Neurological pirates, who cannot rest in peace until they have a permanently accessible source of “thoughts” and “guessings”. And that’s why I live and I’m live as I’m live and that’s why we have great groups of “wonderful” and “not so” with the “guarantee” of complete freedom of thought and self-realization and self-expression on the side of the constitution of the country and international laws. Some groups of people with a radio station require &quot;maintenance personnel&quot;, others require &quot;human shields&quot;, a third require a computer and devices that are not suitable, a quarter require criminals for work, a fifth require investigation without presence.</p>
<p>For all this, we have tele-present observers and operators who are with them 24/7, not only during the investigation of my questions, but these specially trained people who have been studying the structure of the genitals for years and only using the radio alter their structures, &quot;transferring&quot; them from the sources to the &quot;owners&quot;, and if mentioning these organs is mostly tiring or funny, then the nervous systems are more important.</p>
