<p>Today's civilization uses augmentation by radio in many types of human activities, transhumanism is everywhere, from the police and the armed forces to information technology and other things, bypassing only institutions that do not require complex calculations, but there is also a &quot;right&quot;. And, this say science, but only with previous sentence: The human brain perceives radio induction as phenomena of fantasy and other things, through 'processing' by forcing perversions and inflicting insults by specially trained people, to my perception after years of living on fish oil, huge groups of amino acids, vitamins, theamine, guarana, niacin, ginseng and other plant extracts, etc. artificial can be, and I had, phenomena of fantasy, inner voice, emotions, feelings of excitement, dreams and what I have now forgotten.</p>
<p>And this form of the most modern, since 1982 in my country, which has failed, has moved to stagnation and the collection of technical means of implementation, began with the completely incomprehensible and inadequate hanging of the label &quot;products of a planned economy&quot; on all &quot;not such&quot;. Throwing away people's documents that were collected from their birth and giving them new ones, written by a crying &quot;soviet&quot; officer, because &quot;I see my homeland rising from its knees&quot;. And what they say is &quot;by the will of our people you are slaves, we have radio stations on all frequencies&quot;. Neurological pirates, who cannot rest in peace until they have a permanently accessible source of “thoughts” and “guessings”. And that’s why I live and I’m live as I’m live and that’s why we have great groups of “wonderful” and “not so” with the “guarantee” of complete freedom of thought and self-realization and self-expression on the side of the constitution of the country and international laws. Some groups of people with a radio station require &quot;maintenance personnel&quot;, others require &quot;human shields&quot;, a third require a computer and devices that are not suitable, a quarter require criminals for work, a fifth require investigation without presence.</p>
<p>For all this, we have tele-present observers and operators who are with them 24/7, not only during the investigation of my questions, but these specially trained people who have been studying the structure of the genitals for years and only using the radio alter their structures, &quot;transferring&quot; them from the sources to the &quot;owners&quot;, and if mentioning these organs is mostly tiring or funny, then the nervous systems are more important.</p>
<p>This leads me to memories of conversations with other &quot;sources&quot; and my own memories - people build a society according to the division into plebs and those with the right who establish a dictatorship based on the use of the emotionality of the masses, using the theme of military actions, descriptions of war crimes as the necessity of one or another deprivation of rights for one or a group, for example - you are a &quot;curator&quot;, that eyewitnesses say, now we have the right to deprive you of your qualities and make you a source for a person from our society. The &quot;sources&quot; themselves are &quot;prepared&quot; for &quot;fate&quot; from kindergarten, it is a series of specially inflicted psychological traumas, often with sexual overtones or imitation of sexual acts, images committed in the &quot;world&quot;, and under the &quot;instant&quot;, from my memories and stories, this is implemented according to the algorithm - after 3 years until ~20, and after 5 years after. Psychological injuries become the ground for future &quot;programmed&quot; inabilities, for example, to self-defense or defending one's opinion or position. In cases where the &quot;source&quot; begins to tell the public about all this and demand peace, the &quot;police&quot; write a series of special acts in which the entire experience of the person is determined to be traumatic for him/her, imposing &quot;treatment&quot; that can be depicted as plowing furrows in the source's cerebral cortex until the person remembers the claim. In my case, after &quot;erasing&quot; and &quot;transferring&quot; what they need, if the source conscientiously followed the orders of the &quot;rights holders&quot;, there is a compulsion to &quot;apologize&quot; - this can be masturbation and shitting if the victim &quot;right worker&quot;, if not, then the &quot;apology&quot; can contain everything disgusting that comes to mind. In addition, the 'non-plebs' claim that they have copyright over the nervous systems that they have been &quot;creating&quot; for years, carrying out the described actions, and recording biometric data. They do not acknowledge the infliction of psychological trauma by them, and point to the scenes of perversions between children they organized as normal life.</p>
<p>All this builds a capsule for a part of society in which there is no life for them without war using radio equipment ( here about signal filtering ) and cyber weapons and various forms of cyber protection from third parties. Although all of the above will be immediately banned by the institution of local government. As another option, you can live in a way that is completely incompatible with &quot;users&quot;, but in my experience, this leads to a life under &quot;control&quot; where every hand movement is calculated, every second can be controlled by the body, and the &quot;rightful owner&quot; grows to the &quot;source&quot; without obstacles, and with bans after &quot;shootouts&quot; this does not inspire hope for survival.</p>
<p>PS. As another option, you can live in a way that is completely incompatible with &quot;users&quot;, where I am now, for many here now this leads to a life under &quot;control&quot; and &quot;experiment&quot;, with piracy at devices, where every movement is calculated, every second body can be controlled, and the &quot;rightful owner&quot; grows to the &quot;source&quot; without obstacles, and with bans after &quot;cyber shootouts&quot; this does not inspire hope for survival but alternative is described higher.</p>
<p>PS. Their slang is built on the basis of social games in history from mass media where there is a confrontation of good and evil, where it is proposed to take the dark side, but more often on the basis of the history and culture of the people where the victims, initially parts of the mafia, play feudal societies in which they occupy the positions of the nobility, plebs, serfs - people wage war for a better place under the sun. From the main concepts:
- there are people, you can't do anything because of them, first of all to their victims.
- there are &quot;dude&quot;, they serve as proxies in achieving goals in business</p>
<p>They can be called, as in Ukraine and Russia, with literary words - &quot;person&quot;, but keep in mind that this is their eyelids and forehead, this is the most famous example.</p>
