&lt;p&gt;IT administrator and GNU/Linux fan. And sometimes a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer | If you ask me - I'm don`t allow use me and my work to people from &lt;em&gt;Scientology&lt;/em&gt; and cyber-criminals, but who ask ... and BTW I`m use Arch Linux.

&lt;h2&gt;Klimenko/Tsikunkov Maxim Sergievich&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT administrator and GNU/Linux fan. And sometimes a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer | If you ask me - I'm don`t allow use me and my work to people from &lt;em&gt;Scientology&lt;/em&gt; and cyber-criminals, but who ask ... and BTW I`m use Arch Linux. In our days we can find criminals and slave traders in police departments, army or other government services ( like SSU ) and this people can be in &lt;em&gt;scientology&lt;/em&gt; or with other dangerous poin of view on your life ... Like piracy and &amp;quot;hackers&amp;quot; ( pseudo hackers or just fucking criminals ) from mirgorod and other cult, as for me a piracy ( True piracy or first numbers of piracy networks ) is the same dangerous and destructive cult as some others, controlled city. And they try to control me like electromagnetic disraptor chases away crowd of birds, they do this every day. Who super-genius give work in police or army to the people form cults? .....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to apologize to modern, non-criminal and normal members of Scientology or other religious society, this is not about you. And I never want to apologize to Ukraine army, police, goverment and fucking creathures from SSU. Becase looks like this fucking creatures trade me to scientology for using when I go to elementary school. An im not a Scientologyst and newer be him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may write here what &amp;quot;people&amp;quot; already knew, but then I just learned that the &amp;quot;native&amp;quot; army ( in past they be a part of army, but now I too far from this structures ) and its assistants forbade me to know because they wanted to use me as a pair with their assistants ( like unofficial scientology, piracy or bandits ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fucking stupid assholes decide take me to the slavery and share all my life from every day to Ukrainian unofficial Scientology members, they work on my brainwashing like in the past but with nuances from Aum Shinrikyo. In Ukraine they can steal your passport from e-government and ..... but its not main reason, in this place they like human traders - they do not recognize the rights of their chosen people and invent reasons for this. And I, after 2 years of electromagnetic burning I feel myself like in prison with dead brain... But all this time I just live in my home with my grandpa and work in IT.&lt;/p&gt;
