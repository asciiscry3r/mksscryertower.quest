&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/580-19#Text"&gt;From Article 42&lt;/a&gt;. Police coercive measures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The police, while exercising the powers specified by this Law, is authorized to apply the following coercive measures:
1) physical influence (force);
2) use of special means;
3) use of firearms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical influence is the use of any physical force, as well as special methods of struggle in order to stop illegal actions of offenders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special means as police measures of coercion are a set of devices, devices and objects specially made, structurally intended and technically suitable for protecting people from damage by various objects (including weapons), temporary (reversal) damage to a person (offender, opponent ), suppression or restriction of a person's will (psychological or physical) by exerting influence on it or the objects surrounding it, with a clear regulation of the grounds and rules for the use of such means and service animals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To fulfill their powers, police officers may use the following special means:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rubber and plastic batons;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;electric shock devices of contact and contact-distance action;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;means of limiting mobility (handcuffs, nets for tying, etc.);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;means equipped with lachrymatory and irritating substances;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;means of forced traffic stop;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;special marking and coloring means;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;service dogs and service horses;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;light-sound devices, grenades and ammunition;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myrhorod people are now like Hubbard's ~rondroinds~, but their will has been broken by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mksscryertower.quest/Health Effects in RF Electromagnetic fields.html"&gt;microwaves&lt;/a&gt;. The police themselves claim that microwaves and other ranges cannot harm people, lethally dangerous levels of the background are only ~good~. At the same time, human trafficking simply flourishes and remains uninvestigated and unpunished. Can lead to promotion or another type of suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

Mirgorod Gogola 139 80 EMF:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" class="align-left" src="images/IMG_20211211_170729.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Military Neuroscience and the Coming Age of Neurowarfare 2016, Armin Krishnan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many studies on microwaves from the 1960s and 1970s have already indicated many of the potential issues: long-term exposure to microwaves can cause genetic mutation, brain tumours and other cancers, behavioural abnormalities (suicide), alterations in biological cycles, weakening of the immune system and alterations in learning ability (Becker, 1990: 214–215; also Brodeur, 1977). A 1970 RAND metastudy on neurological effects of microwaves suggested: ‘it seems likely that neural function, and therefore behavior, are indeed disturbed by low intensity microwaves…the studies consistently and repeatedly report that human beings do exhibit behavioral disturbances when exposed to low intensity microwaves’ (MacGregor, 1970: 8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These conclusions are not too different from some more recent studies that also indicate brain and behavior changes resulting from long-term EMF exposure. For example, a study from 2000 claims: ‘Natural and man-made electromagnetic fields influence the mood and behavior of healthy and sick people. Considerable evidence suggests that electromagnetic fields affect sleep’ (Sher, 2000). Another study from 2006 has linked ambient electromagnetic fields to human moods and behaviour, finding a significantly increased suicide rate during periods of geomagnetic storm (Berk et al., 2006). Continuous electromagnetic field exposure has been linked in scientific studies to ‘cancer, heart disease, sleep disturbance, depression, suicide, anger, rage, violence, homicide, neurological disease and mortality’ (Cherry, 2002). A leaked study on the British police radio system TETRA prepared for the Police Federation of England and Wales contends that microwaves pulsed in certain frequencies can induce paranoia, depression, suicide, manic behaviour and blindness (Trower, 2001: 30).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;WIP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days we can find criminals and slave traders in the police departments, the army or other government agencies (like the SBU), and these people can be in &lt;em&gt;scientology&lt;/em&gt; or with another dangerous point of view on your life ... Like piracy and &amp;quot;hackers &amp;quot;, army creathure, who decide to play in you, pseudo hackers or just fucking criminals, from the Mirgorod part and the other parts of the cult, otherwise it can not be called, as for me piracy (Real piracy or the first numbers in pirate networks) is the same dangerous and destructive cult as some others, they can directly control the cities. And they try to control me like an electromagnetic disruptor drives away a crowd of birds, they do it every day. Which of the &amp;quot;super-genius&amp;quot; people gives a job in the police or the army to such?.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to apologize to the modern, non-criminal and normal members of the Scientology or other religious society, this is not about you. And I never want to apologize to the Ukrainian army, the police, the government and the fucking creatures from the SBU. Because it looks like these fucking creatures sold me to Scientology for using me like a tool when I was in elementary school. I am not a Scientologist and certainly will not be one myself and never was. In the meantime, our security forces and special services are using electromagnetic weapons to surprise the girl/boy and get her/him into bed. They so cool and powerfull, they can push Linus to creating backdors in Linux. And I see by my eays how they brainwash my mother ... people from local police and other fucking creathures and &amp;quot;frends&amp;quot; - think is related to forced transfer of property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In army and police we have lobby from scientology cults - peoples after &amp;quot;oditing&amp;quot; and other who has interest to brainwashing. They create groups from the young people, give them access to different special devices and users accounts and then you can hear in your house, in microwave specter, songs about how the Cossacks rode. By this listening you must have artificial patriotic feelings or maybe scientology lobby made decision-makers believe in the effectiveness of these methods. In fact, &amp;quot;Cossacks&amp;quot; paired with Scientologists are simply preparing the chosen ones for the fact that everything has already been decided for them, the victims. Some part of Ukrainian people believe in fiction ancestral memory and think about you like about people of 3 kinds - because you wont accept their views and don't want &amp;quot;surrender&amp;quot; to them - as I can know from history and from my life this &amp;quot;surrender&amp;quot; is just slavery and remote control of multiple part of your life and military cigarettes - narcoterror for walking deads. And now when I live like zombie they want use me like part of their network - this creatures use remote control and scanning devices every day and in all cases, they on this weapon when you try to cross road in wrong place. And war not sufficient reason for creating slaves for part of your nation or we really have embryos of the regime in the spirit of Hitler's Germany. And in companies like SocialEdge or CreatorIQ they can steal new software for data analysis and use this for OSINT in social networks, or download in GlobalLogic new firmware for LTE towers ...... etc. If local part of company try to resist they get drugs in coffe from our country protectors. And Russia very like this political aspect, thay say - we are so surprised that you are helping us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the last 2 years I live in electromagnetic fields and cant use phone, notebooks, or just take shower without surveillance from Ukrainian Army or Scientology side - but this in some cases better then old stupid live without consciousness. And because I wont &amp;quot;surrender&amp;quot; they opened a case about my mythical connection with Russia. All this happen only after my tries to live they lobby and sphere of control - I ask government to help me live scientology &amp;quot;MK Ultra&amp;quot; and army piracy program. This 2 structure very fast find consent about me and other losers and, as I can remember, from childhood we have problems with army and scientology and cant normally live in the country that should be ours. Maybe this all has end when they slice and conspect all my brain connection by the using electromagnetic weapon after they send me to the &amp;quot;oditing&amp;quot; and I finally start believe in Xanu or ancestral memory. Or maybe I &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/2021/07/study-wireless-radiation-exposure-children-should-be-hundreds"&gt;get cancer&lt;/a&gt; and die because Ukraine security services and army is a first structures who don't allow getting out of their influence. And Scientology is very useful and tries his best to justify that they are engaged in human trafficking as a reward for their &amp;quot;help&amp;quot;. And now ukraine piracy groups every day try to find new way of attack on human from civil devices and me like slave for this must start buying again cigarettes with drugs because, this &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/assets/files/other/irrc-867-reyes.pdf"&gt;words from&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_psychological_operations"&gt;attackers&lt;/a&gt;, with them I get better filings in my everyday life. After all of this I say to all fucking Ukraine - fuck of from me. None of those who were tortured by these animals will ever be able to be a patriot. But now they will treat everyone who opposes the decisions of the new government or has different views - because back in 2018, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%BB%D1%8E%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8_%D0%B2_%D0%A3%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%97%D0%BD%D1%96_(%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%96%D0%B4%D1%8C)#2014-2018_%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B8"&gt;European law enforcement agencies accused the Ukrainian special services of illegal torture, persecution and other violations of human rights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Ukrainian WIKI:&lt;/p&gt;

Violation of human rights by the SBU

From the appeals received by human rights organizations and
Human Rights Commissioners, it emerged that SBU employees
(as well as prosecutor's offices, internal affairs bodies,
and in 2016 the National Police) often detained people
without a warrant from an investigating judge. In particular,
the persons mentioned in the appeals and who were detained
without the decision of the investigating judge, were
suspected of crimes committed by them, as it was supposed,
several months and even several years before their detention.

In addition, it was emphasized the systematic and massive
violation of the right to legal aid by SBU employees. According
to the Criminal Procedure Code, the official who made the arrest
must immediately notify the body (institution) authorized by
law to provide free legal aid. In case of notification, it is
postponed. If a lawyer from outside the Legal Aid Center is
invited to provide assistance, he or she is usually not
allowed to visit the detainee.

The SBU often re-arrests persons released by the courts.
According to the Criminal Procedure Code, re-arrest is
possible only if the release was made by the decision of
the investigating judge. However, the SBU also arrests
those released by the appeal courts, although the decisions
of the appeal courts are not subject to appeal, according
to the law. Repeated arrests violate Article 5 of the
European Convention and are therefore inadmissible.

Detentions carried out by the SBU in exchange for prisoners
of war and civilian hostages held by the self-proclaimed DPR
and LPR should be considered completely illegal. The SBU
searches for people accused of crimes related to separatism,
treason, terrorism and others, and who are under the
jurisdiction of the SBU, detains them and offers to exchange
them for prisoners in the LPR and DPR instead of criminal
prosecution and longer sentences. The detainees agree to the
exchange because they have no choice. As a result, an agreement
is made with the investigation, the criminal proceedings are closed,
releasing the people from custody, but the SBU employees are
already waiting for them and, after putting them in a car,
they take them to an unknown place, where they are kept without
communication with the outside world until the exchange is
carried out. Sometimes such an exchange is offered to detainees
already after the investigation is completed during the trial.
In such cases, the judge renders a decision without completing
the court process - as a rule, the person is released in the
courtroom after a delay of several years, and the SBU employees
similarly take him to an unknown place,
where he is held incommunicado.
